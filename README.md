## Diagram

## Forward Kinematics


```

        [ v_robot ]  = r * [ 1/2  1/2 ][ w_r_wheel ]
        [ w_robot ]        [ 1/B -1/B ][ w_l_wheel ]


```


## Inverse Kinematics


```

        [ w_r_wheel ]  = [ 1/r  B/2r ][ v_robot ]
        [ w_l_wheel ]    [ 1/r -B/2r ][ w_robot ]


```

where

r is wheel radius

B is distance between wheels

v_robot is linear velocity of robot

w_robot is angular velocity of robot

w_r_wheel is angular velocity of robot's right wheel

w_l_wheel is angular velocity of robot's left wheel


## Wheel Odometry

```

        [ w_r_wheel ]  = [ 1/r  B/2r ][ v_robot ]
        [ w_l_wheel ]    [ 1/r -B/2r ][ w_robot ]


```
## Installation

Step 1: Clone the repository to the src directory of your workspace. You must unzip and put each folder in the src directory.

```

```
## Usage

```

```

## Experiment

### Launch Environment in Map
